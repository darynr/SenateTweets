# SenateTweets

This repository is intended to be an archive of tweets gathered by the @All100Senators twitter account.

Post 02/15/17, I anticipate that data will be updated in batches of ~3k tweets. 

As of 02/07/2017, the fields available are:
created_at: time and date of tweet	
username: user name of the posting account	
userid: user ID of account posting account	
tweet_id_str: ID of the tweet	
in_reply_to_user_id: ID of the person being replied to if any	
text: tweet content

The currently uploaded files are tab-delimited. Some tweets may contain endline characters. (Future logs will be in a slightly different format:1) there will be a signifier for the end of a record to make it easier to deal with the few tweets that contain endlines 2) the delimiter will be different.) 


Some notes on the accounts being followed:

  1. The intent of the account is to aggregate the tweets of sitting US Senators.

  2. My preference is to follow 100 accounts: 1 for each Senator. But I have considered changing that. 
  
  3. Different senators may have different combinations of verified accounts corresponding to personal, Senate office, or campaign activities. In keeping with the above, I've made some decisions on which accounts to follow. Perhaps I've chosen the wrong account to follow in some cases. Or perhaps the restriction to 100 accounts is inappropriate.   
  
  4. Specific changes that have been made:
  Followed @BernieSanders before switching to @SenSanders 
  Followed @stabenow before switching to @SenStabenow
  Followed @ThomTillis before switching to @SenThomTillis
  Missed the first 7 tweets of @SenatorStrange
