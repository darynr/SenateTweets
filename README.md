# SenateTweets

This repository is intended to be an archive of tweets gathered by the @All100Senators twitter account.

After the initial upload of data, I anticipate that data will be updated in batches of ~10k tweets. 


The files are tab-delimited. Some tweets may contain endline characters. 

As of 02/07/2017, the fields available are:
created_at: time and date of tweet	
username: user name of the posting account	
userid: user ID of account posting account	
tweet_id_str: ID of the tweet	
in_reply_to_user_id: ID of the person being replied to if any	
text: tweet content
